# Akari

This project was built with JavaFX, and implements [Akari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_Up_(puzzle)), a [logic puzzle](https://www.puzzle-light-up.com/) with a similar feel to Sudoku or Minesweeper. It is structured around the Model–View–Controller design pattern described in _Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software_.
